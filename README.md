## üéÆ Gameplay Mechanics

### CRPG Token Reward Formula

The CRPG token reward system is designed to incentivize skillful gameplay and exploration. Here's how the reward is calculated:

1. **Base Components**:
   - **Gold**: The amount of gold collected in the chest.
   - **Experience (EXP)**: The experience points earned during gameplay.

2. **Random Bonus**:
   - A random bonus between 1 and 20 is added to ensure variability and excitement.

3. **Scaling Factor**:
   - A scaling factor of `0.01` is applied to balance the economy and ensure fair rewards.

4. **Formula**:
   ```
   Reward = (Gold + EXP) * Scaling Factor + Random Bonus
   ```

5. **Example Calculation**:
   - Gold: 500
   - EXP: 300
   - Random Bonus: 15
   - Scaling Factor: 0.01

   **Reward**:
   ```
   Reward = (500 + 300) * 0.01 + 15 = 8 + 15 = 23 CRPG Tokens
   ```

This formula ensures that rewards are proportional to effort while maintaining an element of surprise.
